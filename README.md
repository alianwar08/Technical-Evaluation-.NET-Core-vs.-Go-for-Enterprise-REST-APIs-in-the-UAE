# Technical Evaluation: .NET Core vs. Go for Enterprise REST APIs in the UAE

## Summary

For REST APIs in enterprise UAE settings, .NET Core is the optimal choice due to its mature ecosystem, strong developer availability, competitive performance, and suitability for complex business requirements. Go remains a strong contender in cloud-native microservices but presents higher hiring and onboarding challenges locally.

| Criteria                 | .NET (C#)                                       | Go (Golang)                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**          | High throughput with improved latency in .NET 8 | Slightly better latency and startup times |
| **Scalability**          | Robust for enterprise applications              | Good for high-concurrency scenarios       |
| **Developer Pool (UAE)** | Large and mature community                      | Smaller, but growing and specialized      |
| **Maintainability**      | Rich powerful tools, potential complexity       | Simple and readable code                  |
| **Ecosystem**            | Extensive and feature-rich                      | Focused on cloud-native solutions         |

## Performance

* Under load, Go and .NET Core both deliver high throughput, but their resource profiles differ. In raw speed tests, modern ASP.NET Core (using Kestrel and AOT) can handle extremely high request rates.
* For example, industry blogs note ASP.NET Core achieving millions of requests/sec in simple micro-benchmarks. ASP.NET Core 8 achieves unmatched throughput due to its optimized threading model, high-performance Kestrel server, and task-based asynchronous handling.
* In summary, .NET Core is "fast and efficient" with continued improvements, but Go’s simplicity yields a smaller runtime footprint under load.

## Scalability

* **.NET**: Offers robust scalability through asynchronous programming patterns (async/await) and is well-suited for enterprise-level applications requiring complex workflows.
* **Go**: Features like goroutines and channels provide efficient concurrency, making it ideal for handling numerous simultaneous connections, such as in microservices architectures (keralait.dev).
* Both platforms scale horizontally on AWS. Containerized microservices: Both .NET (in Linux containers) and Go can be deployed via AWS ECS, EKS (Kubernetes), or Fargate. AWS provides official container images and support for both runtimes.
* .NET Core’s Kestrel web server and middleware pipeline scale well; AWS notes .NET’s modular design (dependency injection, async I/O) makes it "ideal for scalable, cloud-native solutions."

## Developer Availability

* **Go**: While Go's popularity is growing, the developer pool is still smaller compared to .NET. However, its simplicity allows for quicker onboarding.
* **.NET**: Boasts a large and mature developer community, ensuring easier hiring and support.
* Survey and industry data show a larger existing pool of C#/.NET developers. In the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey:

  * C# was used by \~28.8% of professional developers.
  * Go was used by \~14.4%.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Job Openings (UAE)   | Over 140 positions listed on Indeed, 81 in Dubai | 9 positions in Dubai listed on Glassdoor          |
| Available Developers | High availability across major cities            | Limited; \~25 developers in the UAE (Golang Cafe) |
| Common Industries    | Finance, real estate, government, enterprise IT  | Fintech, cloud infrastructure, startups           |
| Typical Experience   | Mid to senior (3–8 years), enterprise background | Senior, cloud-native/microservices expertise      |
| Hiring Difficulty    | Moderate; large talent pool                      | High; niche skillset and limited supply           |

## Job Market

* .NET is widely used in enterprise, finance, and government sectors.
* Go is popular in startups, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps roles.

## Learning Curve

* **.NET**: Steep – due to features like LINQ, async/await, and generics.
* **Go**: Gentle – simple syntax, minimalism, consistent tooling (`go fmt`, `go test`).

## Best Fit

* **.NET**: Teams with enterprise experience and complex business requirements.
* **Go**: Teams valuing minimalism, fast deployment, and simple business needs.

## Market Demand and Compensation

| Metric         | .NET                 | GoLang                |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Average Salary | \$99,270             | \$134,659             |
| Hourly Rate    | \$53.73              | \$64.74               |
| Salary Range   | \$83,144 – \$141,758 | \$115,003 – \$165,000 |
| Senior Salary  | Up to \$143,185      | Up to \$200,000       |

### Hiring Landscape

* **.NET**: More readily available talent, leading to more competitive hiring for employers.
* **Go**: Niche talent pool, requiring targeted recruitment and potentially higher compensation.

## Final Recommendation

Considering the enterprise context in the UAE, .NET 8 with ASP.NET Core is a strategic choice:

* **Talent Availability**: Easier hiring and team scalability with a large local developer pool.
* **Ecosystem Maturity**: Robust tooling and integrations support enterprise-grade applications.
* **Performance**: .NET 8 delivers competitive throughput suitable for high-performance REST APIs.
* **Maintainability**: Established frameworks aid in long-term support and scaling.
* Suggested stack: Dapper or EF Core for DB access, deploy via AWS ECS or Lambda, use Swagger/OpenAPI for API standardization.
* .NET's mature ecosystem lowers total cost of ownership.
