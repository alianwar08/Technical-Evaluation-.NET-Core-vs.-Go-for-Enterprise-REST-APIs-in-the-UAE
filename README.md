Technical Evaluation: .NET Core vs. Go for Enterprise REST APIs in the UAE


Technical Evaluation: .NET Core vs. Go for Enterprise REST APIs in the UAE
Summary Comparison
For REST APIs in enterprise UAE settings, .NET Core is the optimal choice due to its mature ecosystem, strong developer availability, competitive performance, and suitability for complex business requirements. Go remains a strong contender in cloud-native microservices but presents higher hiring and on boarding challenges locally.

Criteria	.NET (C#)	Go (Golang)
Performance	High throughput with improved latency in .NET 8	Slightly better latency and startup times
Scalability	Robust for enterprise applications	Good for high-concurrency scenarios
Developer Pool (UAE)	Large and mature community	Smaller, but growing and specialized
Maintainability	Rich powerful tools, potential complexity	Simple and readable code
Ecosystem	Extensive and feature-rich	Focused on cloud-native solutions

Performance
•	Under load, Go and .NET Core both deliver high throughput, but their resource profiles differ. In raw speed tests, modern ASP.NET Core (using Kestrel and AOT) can handle extremely high request rates.
•	For example, industry blogs note ASP.NET Core achieving millions of requests/sec in simple micro-benchmarks. ASP.NET Core 8 achieves unmatched throughput due to its optimized threading model, high-performance Kestrel server, and task-based asynchronous handling.
•	In summary, .NET Core is “fast and efficient” with continued improvements, but Go’s simplicity yields a smaller runtime footprint under load.

Scalability
•	.NET: Offers robust scalability through asynchronous programming patterns (async/await) and is well-suited for enterprise-level applications requiring complex workflows.
•	Go: Features like go routines and channels provide efficient concurrency, making it ideal for handling numerous simultaneous connections, such as in microservices architectures. (keralait.dev)
•	Both platforms scale horizontally on AWS. Containerized microservices: Both .NET (in Linux containers) and Go can be deployed via AWS ECS, EKS (Kubernetes) or Fargate. AWS provides official container images and support for both runtimes. .NET Core’s Kestrel web server and middleware pipeline scale well; AWS notes .NET’s modular design (dependency injection, async I/O) makes it “ideal for scalable, cloud-native solutions

 
Developer Availability
•	Go: While Go's popularity is growing, the developer pool is still smaller compared to .NET. However, its simplicity allows for quicker on boarding. 
•	.NET: Boasts a large and mature developer community, ensuring easier hiring and support. 
•	Survey and industry data show a larger existing pool of C#/.NET developers, but Go’s popularity is rapidly growing. In the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey - C# was used by ~28.8% of professional developers vs ~14.4% for Go, indicating roughly twice as many developers have .NET experience. 

Metric	.NET Developers	GoLang Developers
Job Openings (UAE)	Over 140 positions listed on Indeed, with 81 in Dubai alone (Indeed, Glassdoor)
9 positions in Dubai listed on Glassdoor (Glassdoor)

Available Developers	High availability; numerous candidates across major cities	Limited availability; 25 developers listed in the UAE (Golang Cafe)

Common Industries	Finance, real estate, government, enterprise IT	Fintech, cloud infrastructure, startups (Sortlist)

Typical Experience Level	Mid to senior (3–8 years), often with full-stack or enterprise backgrounds	Senior-level, often with cloud-native and microservices expertise (Golang Cafe)

Hiring Difficulty	Moderate; large talent pool but competitive for senior roles	High; niche skill set with limited local supply (Sortlist)

Job Market

	Widely used in enterprise, finance, and government sectors	Popular in startups, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps roles
Learning Curve	Steep – due to advanced features like LINQ, async/await, and generics	Gentle – simpler syntax, minimalism, consistent tooling (e.g., go fmt, go test)
Best Fit For	Teams with enterprise experience and complex business requirements	Teams valuing minimalism, fast deployment, and simple business requirements
Demand & Market	High demand, especially in enterprise apps	High demand in cloud, devops, microservices
Average Annual Salary	$99,270	$134,659
Hourly Rate	$53.73	$64.74
Typical Salary Range	$83,144 – $141,758	$115,003 – $165,000
Senior-Level Salary	Up to $143,185	Up to $200,000
		
Hiring Landscape	More readily available talent, potentially leading to more competitive hiring for employers.
	More niche talent, which might require more targeted recruitment efforts and potentially higher compensation for experienced individuals.

In summary, .NET developers are more readily available in the UAE, making hiring relatively straightforward, especially for mid-level positions. In contrast, GoLang developers are fewer in number, leading to a more competitive hiring landscape for this niche skill set.

Final Recommendation
Considering enterprise's context in the UAE, the following factors suggest that .NET 8 with ASP.NET Core would be a strategic choice:
•	Talent Availability: The abundant local .NET developer pool ensures easier hiring and team scalability.
•	Ecosystem Maturity: .NET's comprehensive ecosystem supports enterprise-grade applications with robust tooling and integrations.
•	Performance: With recent enhancements, .NET 8 offers competitive performance suitable for high-throughput REST APIs.
•	Maintainability: Established frameworks and tools facilitate long-term maintainability and scalability.
•	Use Dapper or Entity Framework Core for DB access, deploy via AWS ECS or Lambda, and standardize on Swagger/OpenAPI.
•	.NET's mature ecosystem will lower total cost of ownership.

•	“For big business applications with lots of data, .NET is good as it can work with many programming languages and Microsoft technologies. But if you need a fast and scalable system with lots of users, Golang is a better option because it can handle multiple tasks at the same time because of its ability to handle concurrency and scalability.”
